# ShapeRx

Classification of anatomical shapes. 

Theme: Healt, wellness and fitness

## Design

1. Naive approach : B&w histograms? 
2. Non-deep learning approach : ?
3. NN-based approach : PyTorch-based convolutional neural network 

## Development

For dependencies, see [requirements](requirements.txt). 

If working on the UI, run in gradio development mode: 

`gradio app/app.py`

âš¡ The app expects to be run from the root of the repo, not the app directory. Mostly because we have the 'data' directory hardcoded.

## Testing 

TODO

## Deployment

The model can be demonstrated by deploying the included gradio application. 

1. cd <repo>/app
2. python app.py 
3. point browser at http://127.0.0.1:7860
